# Tic Tac Toe 3D

Tic Tac Toe 3D is a community-driven project that aims to create a more complex and challenging version of the classic game across three dimensions. It is built with Python and Pytorch and runs on Google Colab. It uses a program design similar to AlphaGo Zero to train its model. One eventual goal of the model is to have it be better than human players at the game. It is also open source and licensed under the MIT license.

To run Tic Tac Toe 3D, follow these steps:

- Open this Google Colab notebook: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lLiFUCJPQh-G1xhiPFf397-hksghlygL
- Run the cells in the notebook to try it out.
- Enjoy playing Tic Tac Toe 3D!

## Features

Tic Tac Toe 3D has the following features:

- A 3D board with 27 cells (3x3x3).
- A widget-based graphical user interface that allows you to play against the computer.
- A reinforcement learning model that learns from its own experience and improves over time.
- A difficulty level that can be adjusted to match your skill level.

## Contributing
Our project aims to create a 3D version of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, using the MCTS algorithm and a neural network to train an intelligent agent. We are always open to new ideas and suggestions to make our project better and more enjoyable. You can contribute to Tic Tac Toe 3D w/MCTS in two main ways:

- Machine Learning Part: You can help us improve the learning process by adding new features, optimizing the code, or trying different hyperparameters. You can also propose new games or domains that can be tackled by the MCTS algorithm and the neural network.
- Game & Evaluation Part: You can help us enhance the game experience by adding new rules, Google Colab Widgets, or Python Code. You can also evaluate the agent's performance and strategy by playing against it or analyzing its moves.

Whether you are a machine learning fan, a game lover, or a curious explorer, you are welcome to join our community of AI and gaming enthusiasts. You will also learn new skills and gain valuable experience along the way. We appreciate your interest and support in our project and we hope you have fun with it as much as we do.

Tic Tac Toe 3D welcomes contributions from anyone who wants to improve or enhance the project. To contribute, please follow these steps:

- Fork this repository and create a new branch
