# Tic Tac Toe 3D

Tic Tac Toe 3D is a community-driven project that aims to create a more complex and challenging version of the classic game across three dimensions. It is built with Python and Pytorch and runs on Google Colab. It uses a program design similar to AlphaGo Zero to train its model. One eventual goal of the model is to have it be better than human players at the game. It is also open source and licensed under the MIT license.
