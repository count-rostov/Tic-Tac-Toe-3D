# Tic Tac Toe 3D

Greetings, esteemed AI enthusiast. Prepare to immerse yourself in the realm of Tic Tac Toe 3D, a veritable goldmine for machine learning aficionados keen to experiment with a simplified rendition of AlphaGo Zero. Recall AlphaGo Zero? The autonomous learning algorithm that astounded the world with its unparalleled prowess in the game of Go, devoid of any human instruction or intervention. Within this repository, you will discover PyTorch code and a Google Colab notebook that modifies a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm for an intriguing 3D Tic Tac Toe game.

The rules of the game are straightforward yet captivating: players take turns placing their mark in a 3x3x3 grid, aiming to align three of their marks in any direction - horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, without the constraint of a single plane. It’s a game that’s easy to comprehend and implement, yet it presents a myriad of challenges for those beginning their journey into model training with an Alpha Zero-like algorithm. Subsequently, when you feel prepared, embrace the game’s complexity and the algorithm’s sophistication, even consider delving into distributed computing and generalized games.

Thus, we cordially invite you to join us on this exhilarating exploration of AI’s remarkable capabilities and potential! Engage with our code, notebook, and model. We eagerly anticipate your contributions and feedback.

## Contributing
Our project aims to create a 3D version of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, using the MCTS algorithm and a neural network to train an intelligent agent. We are always open to new ideas and suggestions to make our project better and more enjoyable. You can contribute to Tic Tac Toe 3D w/MCTS in two main ways:

- Machine Learning Part: You can help us improve the learning process by adding new features, optimizing the code, or trying different hyperparameters. You can also propose new games or domains that can be tackled by the MCTS algorithm and the neural network.
- Game & Evaluation Part: You can help us enhance the game experience by adding new rules, Google Colab Widgets, or Python Code. You can also evaluate the agent's performance and strategy by playing against it or analyzing its moves.

Whether you are a machine learning fan, a game lover, or a curious explorer, you are welcome to join our community of AI and gaming enthusiasts. You will also learn new skills and gain valuable experience along the way. We appreciate your interest and support in our project and we hope you have fun with it as much as we do.
